## Ruby Parser (November 2019)

**Project description:** In Concepts of Programming class, I was introduced with a new language Ruby. One of our lab assignment was to create a parsing program that had lexical and syntax analyzer that analyzes the .cpl file for any lexical or syntax error. If the error is detected, the program gives out a proper message and exits the program. If no error is detected, according to which flag the user specified (-s for scheme and -p for prolog), the user will get a proper output that can be transferred to another program for later assignments.

I was pleasently surprised on how powerful, yet simple Ruby is compared to other coding languages, and I really enjoyed the learning process of Ruby. This really opened up my perspective on using another programming languages and answered my personal question of "Why do we need more than one programming language?". Along with that, I also got to learn a new concept called regular expressions (REGEX) and realized how easy it made programming for me.
