## Summer Software Engineering Internship (April 2020 - July 2020)

**Internship Description:** The company that I got to work at for my summer internship in 2020 was VillaVox. Villa vox is a startup real estate company seeking to create a community of people who are interested in home buying and selling through their website. Since this company is a startup company, I wasnâ€™t placed in an official department, but along with my coworker, I got to experience every aspect of web development, such as hosting a webpage, building a webpage using REACT, creating a web application by utilizing API, managing the database with Firebase.
