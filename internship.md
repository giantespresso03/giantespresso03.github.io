## Summer Software Engineering Internship (April 2020 - July 2020)

**Internship Description:** The company that I got to work at for my summer internship in 2020 was VillaVox. Villa vox is a startup real estate company seeking to create a community of people who are interested in home buying and selling through their website. Since this company is a startup company, I wasn’t placed in an official department, but along with my coworker, I got to experience every aspect of web development, such as hosting a webpage, building a webpage using REACT, creating a web application by utilizing API, managing the database with Firebase. 

The major part of my internship was developing the webpages for VillaVox as they didn’t have a completed website launched yet. VillaVox’s CEO, Katherine Shiao, already had UI/UX designers create a prototype webpage in advance on a collaboration software called Zeplin. The prototype already had all of the specifications ready for me to use as a reference (such as the RGB color value, pixel length, font), and I used and applied those specifications in my code to build a functioning website for VillaVox. I used tools such as HTML and CSS, but the tool that I used and utilized the most was the React.js library and Bootstrap framework from JavaScript. I used React.js to build most of the UI components such as the dropdown menus, side scrollbars, and buttons due to its simplicity, recyclability, and overall readability of code. For this specific internship activity, I was the only one who was in charge of it, so I had to study everything from scratch because I didn’t even know how to create a simple website using HTML and CSS at the beginning of the internship. This part of the internship was very crucial for my internship employer (CEO) as this company wouldn’t be able to run if there’s no website to launch and attract users. The completion of the VillaVox home page finally allowed our CEO to officially launch the fully functional website under the domain name of villavox.com, and finally allowed the CEO to start running her business.
