## Tic-Tac-Toe Game (April 2019)

**Project Description:** In Applications Programming class, I was assigned to create a simple tic-tac-toe application using QT Creator. I really enjoyed working on this application as it really strengthened my skill as a software developer, and allowed me to see things in a broader perspective in terms of user experience with the UI. 

This application presents the users with two options to play the game of tic-tac-toe: Classic button clicking and coordinate entering. The user is able to change between two options whenever they want to, and they also can reset the game whenever they would like to as well. While developing this app, I tried my best to emphasize the look of the application, especially when it comes to the color palette and font so that the application feels "smooth" when the user experiences it.
