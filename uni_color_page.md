## Uni Color (August 2019 - Current)

**Project description:** Along with a group of friends, I started a private hackathon during summer break for fun. We took around 15 hours to create this application from scratch (including paintings and background music). Our group primarily used Unity along with other softwares such as FL Studio to collaborate effectively.

The primary game mechanism is based on tilt control with acceleration, and the user has to avoid the differently colored astroids while crashing into the blue astroid in order to gain health. If the user keeps avoiding all of the astroids, the health slowly deplinishes, and when the health bar reaches zero, the UFO explodes. We also added particle system so that the glowing stars in the background is randomly generated.

While we did not entirely finish the game due to lack of energy, sleep, and motivation on that day, we promised to finish making this game and possibly try publishing to the Apple App Store and Google Game Center to further explore the world of app/game development.
